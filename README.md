?? Multi-Touch Attribution ROI Calculator (AI-Powered)
An interactive web application that simulates real-world digital advertising attribution across multiple channels and touchpoints.
The system compares multiple attribution models and uses AI-driven analysis to recommend data-backed budget allocation strategies.
Built to demonstrate ad-tech system thinking, analytics modeling, and AI-assisted decision making.

?? Problem Statement
In real marketing systems, conversions are influenced by multiple touchpoints (search, social, display, email, etc.).
Traditional last-click attribution often misrepresents true channel impact, leading to poor budget decisions.
This project addresses that by:
* Simulating multi-touch user journeys
* Applying multiple attribution models
* Comparing ROI across models
* Generating AI-assisted budget recommendations

?? Attribution Models Implemented
* Last-Click Attribution
* First-Click Attribution
* Linear Attribution
* Time-Decay Attribution
* Position-Based (U-Shaped) Attribution
Each model distributes revenue differently across channels, allowing marketers to understand trade-offs and bias.

AI Budget Recommendation Engine (Gemini)

?? AI-Powered Budget Strategy
The application uses Google Gemini to analyze:
* Spend vs revenue
* ROI per channel
* CTR and conversion efficiency
* Selected attribution model
The AI outputs:
* Specific budget reallocation actions
* Projected impact on ROI and conversions
* Clear, executive-friendly insights
AI is used as a decision support layer, not a black-box replacement.

?? Key Features
* Dynamic campaign input (manual or sample data)
* Simulated multi-touch user journeys
* Side-by-side attribution comparison
* ROI visualization using interactive charts
* AI-generated budget recommendations
* Clean, modern analytics dashboard UI

?? Sample Use Cases
* Compare how ROI changes across attribution models
* Identify under-funded high-ROI channels
* Understand bias of last-click attribution
* Simulate budget strategy decisions before scaling spend

??? Tech Stack
Frontend
* React.js
* Recharts (data visualization)
* Lucide Icons
AI & Analytics
* Google Gemini API
* Custom attribution logic (client-side)
* AI-assisted insights (server-side recommended)
Styling
* Custom inline styling (glassmorphism-inspired UI)

?? Important Note on AI Usage
For security and best practices:
* Gemini API calls should be routed through a backend service
* API keys must never be exposed in frontend code
This design mirrors production ad-tech systems.

?? Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates:
* Understanding of real ad-tech attribution problems
* Ability to design end-to-end analytical systems
* Strong product + engineering mindset
* Practical use of AI for decision intelligence

?? Future Enhancements
* Markov / data-driven attribution
* Real campaign data ingestion
* Attribution model comparison metrics
* Cost-aware AI optimization
* Exportable reports for stakeholders
